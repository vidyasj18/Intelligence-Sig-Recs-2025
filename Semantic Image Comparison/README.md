# Semantic Dataset Comparison

## Overview

Your task is to develop a deep learning pipeline that computes semantic similarity scores between two image datasets. The goal is to build a system that can understand and compare the semantic content of images, going beyond simple pixel-level comparisons.

## Important Guidelines

- Feel free to use any pre-trained models.
- As this is an open ended task, please explain your method and provide links to any papers you have used for this.

## Requirements

### Input

- **Dataset A**: A collection of images
- **Dataset B**: A collection of images

### Output

- **Similarity Score**: A numerical score indicating semantic similarity between the two datasets. You are free to define how this works. The score can also be split into numerous sub-scores indicating various aspects of similarity.


## Experiments

- Exp 1: Give the similarity score between different classes of [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
- Exp 2: Check for the similarity between real and generated data in [CIFAKE](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/birdy654/cifake-real-and-ai-generated-synthetic-images/data)

Good luck ! 🚀
